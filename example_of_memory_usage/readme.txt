BRAM memory usage. 
In the project, you will find one ROM memory with coe file and one true dual-port RAM. 
Data from ROM memory is written to the dual-port RAM, and at the same time, the data is read from the dual-port RAM to the board LEDs. 
The demo project also includes the simulation file so you can run synthesis and post-synthesis simulation. 
Also, you can put this project in the zybo board but you should increase the value of prescaller to see the effect.
